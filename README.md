# MLOps Templates

This repository contains project templates dedicated to MLOps.

You can find templates for ML models and datasets. Go to each folder to checkout the templates.

## How to use it

### Install cookiecutter

I recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv tool install cookiecutter
```

You could also use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/).

```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```

### Generate you project

Go to the parent directory of where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
cookiecutter <path-to-the-chosen-template>
```

The generator (cookiecutter) will then ask you for some inputs.
